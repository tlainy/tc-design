                        <p class="text-body-base">Evolve is a vacation rental management company focused on delivering 5‑star guest experiences and management services for vacation rental owners. Most of Evolve’s owner users fall within the 45–64 age range and are distributed across the US.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3 class="text-heading-3">Problem</h3>
                        <p class="text-body-base">The Owner Account (OA) was outdated, fragmented, and difficult to use. Over 30k owners relied on it weekly, if not daily. Built on Salesforce Communities, which meant it was hard to scale and customize, and the legacy experience broke accessibility standards, used clunky flows that often led to dead ends, and forced owners to call support for basic tasks. This eroded trust and created major inefficiencies. Compared to competitors like Airbnb and Vrbo, Evolve’s OA felt opaque and left owners disempowered. To move forward, we needed a modern platform, a stronger research foundation, and a scalable design that rebuilt trust and put owners back in control. This was originally a 1:1 feature parity project.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3 class="text-heading-3">Solution</h3>
                        <p class="text-body-base">I partnered with another designer to redesign the Owner Account (OA) on a modern platform with a new design system, refreshed branding, and improved information architecture. I unified web and mobile, prioritized self-serve features, and removed frustrating dead ends. We rolled out iteratively—starting with mobile, where ~56% of users were active—while keeping the legacy platform live to ease adoption. I conducted continuous usability testing with our researcher to ground decisions in data, partnered with content marketing on new Owner Accountguidelines, and designed micro-interactions that made the experience feel polished.</p>

                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3 class="text-heading-3">Impact</h3>
                        <p class="text-body-base">The redesign significantly boosted satisfaction and usability. Nearly 90% of owners rated the new experience as extremely user-friendly, often calling out the cleaner layout and streamlined navigation as major improvements over legacy. Repeat bug reports dropped by ~30% and support calls for legacy issues declined as well.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-heading-3">The problem, in detail</h3>
                    <p class="text-body-base">When I started this project, the legacy Owner Account (OA) was a mystery box. Opening it was like opening Pandora’s box. Built years earlier on the Salesforce Communities platform, it had little documentation and was a patchwork of flows that didn’t always connect.</p>
                    <p class="text-body-base">Owner NPS was declining as users grew frustrated with an experience that no longer met their needs. Compared to competitors like Airbnb and Vrbo, the platform lacked the self-serve tools and transparency owners expected. Too often, they hit dead ends that pushed them to call or email for support, leaving them feeling dependent on Evolve rather than empowered as partners in their own vacation rental journey.</p>
                    <p class="text-body-base">Digging into the problem revealed how heavily technical debt held us back—small fixes were slow, messy, and often invisible to users. The result was an outdated product that fell short of modern standards, leaving owners wanting a self-serve, mobile-first, and transparent experience. To move forward, we needed a redesigned experience that delivered the familiar functionality they expected.</p>

                    <p class="text-body-base">Our ultimate goal with the redesign was 1:1 feature parity, but I also saw it as a chance to make meaningful UX improvements without ballooning scope or timelines. It meant I had to stay lean and creative.</p>
                    <p class="text-body-base">Looking back, delivering a full web and app redesign felt like orchestrating a smorgasbord of methods, workflows, and responsibilities. I defined the solutions by:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="text-body-base"><span class="text-body-base-bold">Redefining the foundation:</span> I audited the legacy IA, combined findings with research insights, and redesigned navigation across app and web to better support user goals.</li>
                        <li class="text-body-base"><span class="text-body-base-bold">Mapping end-to-end journeys:</span> This helped me identify expectations we weren’t meeting and pinpoint where creative design could make the biggest impact within our constraints. I also documented the communication received at each phase in the user's journey.</li>
                        <li class="text-body-base"><span class="text-body-base-bold">Iterating designs with cross-functional input:</span> For every feature, I started with quick wires, reviewed feasibility with engineering, tested with users, and refined into final designs.</li>

                                <li class="text-body-base">Since mobile app usage was higher (users loved push notifications) we started with the new app experience first, followed shortly by web. I partnered with the PMs to prioritize the feature release order, using both feature usage stats and importance based on task analysis.</li>
