                        <p class="text-body-base">Evolve is a vacation rental management company focused on delivering 5‑star guest experiences and management services for vacation rental owners. Most of Evolve’s owner users fall within the 45–64 age range and are distributed across the US. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3 class="text-heading-3">Problem</h3>
                        <p class="text-body-base">In the vacation rental industry, homeowners often need the ability to cancel guest bookings quickly, whether due to maintenance issues, double bookings, or unexpected personal circumstances. At Evolve, however, the process was manual and cumbersome: owners had to submit a support request, call, or email to make a cancellation. Because cancellations are time-sensitive, this dependency on frontline teams frustrated owners and left guests with less time to adjust their travel plans. The lack of a self-serve option not only slowed resolution but also eroded trust in the platform’s ability to support both owners and guests in critical moments.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3 class="text-heading-3">Solution</h3>
                        <p class="text-body-base">I designed a self-serve cancellation flow for the responsive web Owner Account experience. Since booking cancellation rules differ across distribution partners like Airbnb and Vrbo, the solution needed to balance clarity, guidance, and compliance. The final design combined step-by-step instructions, education, and document collection to simplify what had been a complex approval process. At the same time, I built in strategic content to help owners understand the impact cancellations have on their rental performance—encouraging fewer cancellations overall.</p>

                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3 class="text-heading-3">Impact</h3>
                        <p class="text-body-base">The new self-serve booking cancellation tool saw immediate adoption, with ~20%  of the cancellations completed by owners in the first month. Our data dashboard revealed significant drop-off rates in each successive step or section. Drop-off was good in this case, signaling that owners were pausing to reconsider canceling after understanding the consequences. In other words, the tool not only enabled self-service but also successfully influenced behavior, helping reduce unnecessary cancellations.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-heading-3">The problem, in detail</h3>
                    <p class="text-body-base">Guest booking cancellations were inherently complex. Since Evolve owners’ properties were listed across multiple distribution partners like Airbnb and Vrbo, each with its own rules and penalties, owners faced varying requirements when canceling. Cancellation fees acted as a deterrent, discouraging owners from backing out of bookings since cancellations negatively impacted their performance, search ranking, and long-term guest satisfaction. At the same time, these penalties upheld trust and credibility on the platform by holding owners to consistent standards.</p>
                    <p class="text-body-base">Fees were calculated based on how close the cancellation was to the guest’s check-in date and the reason for canceling, often amounting to a percentage of the total booking. In certain cases, owners could request a waive fee, but this required timely submission of specific documentation—adding another layer of complexity to the process.</p>
                    <p class="text-body-base">Speed to cancel a booking was a clear issue. Due to the complex process of varying distribution partners, users couldn't handle their own cancellation without additional education. Lastly, users didn't understand or believe there were short- and long-term impacts on their property performance caused by canceling. There were 3 main themes: speed, education, and persuasion.</p>

                    <p class="text-body-base">I took a step back to understand the current state of the cancellation process through the lens of speed, education, and persuasion. How might we be hitting or missing the mark from the user and internal team perspectives?</p>

                    <p class="text-body-base">To assess where we could have better informed or persuaded users to reconsider their decision:</p>

                    <p class="text-body-base">I created a prototype, designing a hybrid solution based on the 3 variations of wireframes.</p>
                    <p class="text-body-base">Overall, the cancellation flow performed well with users saying it was fast and easy to use. All users successfully navigated the process and clearly understood that their request was in progress. They also consistently valued the alternative options, with most indicating a preference for offering a discount instead of canceling. Based on the feedback, it seemed like the solution had a considerable impact on the user's perceived speed of the process and comprehension of the cancellation outcome. I decided to move forward with Version 2 for final designs.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-heading-3">Solution</h3>
                    <p class="text-body-base">Based on the test findings, I designed a solution that focused on delivering personalized, high-value alternative options to create for the user a moment of reflection (e.g. providing guest discounts). I sprinkled education throughout the process by way of tips and links to external resources with the goal of communicating the potential negative impact of canceling. I also simplified the whole process by trimming down the amount of text on screen and creating an all-in-one cancellation tool for canceling and requesting a waiver to minimize back and forth seen in the current process.</p>
                    <p class="text-body-base">The final solution had a total of 6 steps. This was intentional as I wanted to make sure we had room to education and inform the user before they made their final decision. You can dive into the figma for the nitty gritty details.</p>

                    <p class="text-body-base">The new self-serve booking cancellation tool saw immediate adoption, with ~20% of the cancellations completed by owners in the first month. Our data dashboard revealed significant drop-off rates in each successive step, which my team saw as a success—we were successfully deterring the user from canceling with appropriately placed education and tips.</p>
