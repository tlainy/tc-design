                        <p class="text-body-base">Transamerica is a financial services company that helps millions of people prepare for retirement through investment products and workplace retirement plans. Their focus is on making financial planning more accessible, building trust through education, and supporting people in living healthier, wealthier lives*.</p>
                        <p class="text-body-base">*Wealth and Health℠ was the main tenet in the Transamerica philosophy: protecting your Health can pay dividends in the future. Wealth and Health℠ focuses on a more holistic approach to retirement journey management, one that’s also focused on physical and mental wellbeing.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3 class="text-heading-3">Problem</h3>
                        <p class="text-body-base">Transamerica has two retirement journey management mobile apps: one app places a focus on Wealth and Health℠* but lacks the functionality the users need (more recent); the other app meets the users’ needs but does not embrace the Wealth and Health℠ philosophy (legacy). We needed to merge the two mobile apps into one. We had to rethink the architecture, interaction flow, and visual design while keeping inline with the Transamerica philosophy.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3 class="text-heading-3">Solution</h3>
                        <p class="text-body-base">I designed a new mobile app experience that made complex features easier to use, streamlined the navigation and information architecture, and refreshed the overall UI. I also rethought how we approached retirement education—making it more approachable and digestible for our users. The end experience was a combination of new design and redesign of the former app.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-heading-3">Impact</h3>
                        <p class="text-body-base">We completed all feature designs in the provided timeline of six months. In order to make the design-developer handoff seamless, we created style guides to ensure our design vision could be easily understood and to set a foundation for the next releases. The Transamerica Retirement App was released in December, 2020.</p>

                    <p class="text-body-base">Transamerica has two retirement journey management mobile apps: one app places a focus on Wealth and Health but lacks the functionality the users need (more recent); the other app meets the users’ needs but does not embrace the Wealth and Health philosophy (legacy). We needed to merge the two into one. I asked myself:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="text-body-base">How could we design a mobile app that embodies the Wealth and Health philosophy and provide key retirement journey management functionality?</li>
                        <li class="text-body-base">How could we create a space that could engage the users beyond the simple task of checking account balances? </li>
                        <li class="text-body-base">How could we add, improve, or augment 21 features in a design deliverable timeline of six months?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-body-base">One of our biggest design challenges was working within those constraints and minimizing any new patterns or styles; we had to stick with what was in the more recent app and build on that. We had a small yet very effective team of three designers and one researcher.</p>

                        <li class="text-body-base">The user base of the more recent app was upset about the lack of financial tools that were available in the legacy app.</li>
                        <li class="text-body-base">The users of the more recent app were confused: Why was Transamerica requiring users to answer Health questions when they just wanted to check their account status? What does Health have to do with Wealth?</li>
                        <li class="text-body-base">The user base of the more recent app reverted to the legacy app as that offered more functionality, even though the experience and visuals were outdated.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="text-body-base">Place emphasis on financial features</li>

                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-body-base">Paired designing was key at this phase. We created a lot of mockups and finally ended on three main nav items: Overview, Manage, More.</p>
