                        <h3 class="text-heading-3">Overview</h3>
                        <p class="text-body-base">Evolve is a vacation rental management company focused on delivering 5‑star guest experiences and management services for vacation rental owners. Most of Evolve’s owner users fall within the 45–64 age range and are distributed across the US.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3 class="text-heading-3">Problem</h3>
                        <p class="text-body-base">For property bookings, there was fragmented communication between guests, owners, and frontline teams at Evolve due to a lack of an on-platform communication tool. Frontline teams would handle the guest requests but would often need to contact the owner for final approval. In other cases, the owner would coordinate with the guest directly and off-platform (i.e. SMS, email). This led to confusion, duplicated work, and delayed responses to guest needs. It eroded guest trust and left owners frustrated by a lack of visibility. We needed to change how we approached communication and to redefine what support looked like for the guest and owner for all booking phases, such as when a guest booked to when a guest checks out.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3 class="text-heading-3">Solution</h3>
                        <p class="text-body-base">I designed Inbox, a centralized hub consolidating all communication between guests, owners, and frontline teams. We prioritized speed by releasing an MVP for our partner Airbnb bookings, informed by research into owner behaviors, guest messaging patterns, and industry standards. Key design decisions included enabling messaging 4–7 days before check-in (when most guest questions occurred) and embedding education to reframe owner engagement as essential to performance. Success was defined by improved response times, reduced off-platform communication, and increased owner adoption.</p>

                    <div class="content-section">
                        <h3 class="text-heading-3">Impact</h3>
                        <p class="text-body-base">The beta rollout showed strong early results: 83% of owners reported Inbox made guest communication easier, 73% found it valuable, and response times dropped by 98%. The beta demonstrated our ability to streamline workflows, improve guest experiences, and set the foundation for scalable communication improvements across Evolve.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-heading-3">The problem, in detail</h3>
                    <p class="text-body-base"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Problem 1:</span> Communication for a property booking between guests, owners, and frontline teams happened in silos, leaving each party without visibility into the others’ interactions. Nearly half of bookings required manual intervention, with many guest requests still needing owner approval. This created gaps that prevented Evolve from delivering a seamless experience.  <span style="color: var(--color-fire-500);">How could we give guests direct access to owners when needed and allow owners to address booking requests on their own—without delays or bottlenecks?</span></p>
                    <p class="text-body-base"><span style="font-weight: 700;">Problem 2:</span> Owners had varying expectations of how hands-on Evolve would be in managing guests and bookings. In reality, owners could never be fully removed—certain requests and issues always required their approval, and their engagement was critical to rental success. <span style="color: var(--color-fire-500);">How could we reframe success so that owners see engagement as essential, not optional, to their rental’s performance?</span></p>
                    <p class="text-body-base">I needed to solve for three distinct users—Owners, Guests, and frontline teams—each with unique needs:</p>

They worried guests would feel unsure whether to contact them or Evolve when issues arose. Regardless of communication tool, owners wanted to establish a personal connection with guests, as that may have resulted in a positive guest review after their stay.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-heading-3">Solution</h3>
                    <p class="text-body-base">We needed to release quickly and gather learnings right away. We decided on a beta release focusing on Inbox for partner Airbnb bookings only. My key design questions were:</p>
                    <p class="text-body-base"><span style="color: var(--color-fire-500);">How could we give guests direct access to owners when needed and allow owners to address booking requests on their own—without delays or bottlenecks?</span> I needed to build a seamless, transparent communication platform that let owners manage interactions and give guests a smooth experience, while making it clear which user was handling which request.</p>
                    <p class="text-body-base"><span style="color: var(--color-fire-500);">How might we reframe success so owners see messaging as essential to rental performance?</span> Integrated education into UI and marketing, positioning Inbox as a core management tool to boost efficiency and engagement.</p>
                    <p class="text-body-base">In addition to that, discovery showed most guest requests came 4–7 days pre-check-in, a critical window for connection. Rather than granting access only after check-in, I proposed opening messaging earlier to drive adoption and reduce issues. The team was on board with this idea and we adjusted the roadmap.</p>
                    <p class="text-body-base">I then defined our success metrics with my PM:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="text-body-base"><span class="text-body-base-bold">Owners:</span> Less reliance on off-platform tools, indicated by decreased SMS or emails sent.</li>
                        <li class="text-body-base"><span class="text-body-base-bold">Guests:</span> Faster responses, fewer repeated questions, consistent communication.</li>
                        <li class="text-body-base"><span class="text-body-base-bold">Frontline teams:</span> Lower service costs, fewer escalations, greater transparency.</li>
                        <li class="text-body-base"><span class="text-body-base-bold">Business:</span> Higher NPS, improved response time, stronger review trends.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-body-base">I started with mockups and an initial beta flow. I then created a user journey map to build empathy for the user. Once I presented the general design direction to the team, I worked with the Researcher to test the initial designs with users. We found in testing that our users thought the design was user-friendly and easy to understand.</p>

                <p class="text-body-base">Due to the timeline of beta and releasing sooner to gather learnings, the beta was lean. I designed a minimal Inbox feature with a few educational interactions to help solve the problem of engagement and adoption. To make it easier for users to handle booking requests from Inbox, I created a pathway to the existing booking view.</p>
                <p class="text-body-base">In my design work for beta and future releases, I made sure to address their needs mentioned in the survey (see <a href="#discovery-carousel">Discovery</a>), which included automated messaging, easier dispute resolution, a guest review system, clear guidelines on communication expectations between owner and guests. </p>

Once the team aligned, my PM and I used them to reshape the roadmap and plan future releases through 2025.

A technical pivot later shifted the timeline, so they weren’t released while I was there—but the vision and groundwork were set for the team to carry forward.</p>
